1.1 Numbers and symbols

   First, we have to distinguish the difference between numbers and the symbols we use to represent
numbers. A number is a mathematical quantity, usually correlated in electronics to a physical
quantity such as voltage, current, or resistance. There are many different types of numbers. Here
are just a few types, for example:
WHOLE NUMBERS:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 . . .













INTEGERS:Z
-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . .






REAL NUMBERS: R
(All one-dimensional numerical values, negative and positive,
including zero, whole, integer, and irrational numbers)




IRRATIONAL NUMBERS:
Ï€ (approx. 3.1415927), e (approx. 2.718281828),
square root of any prime











COMPLEX NUMBERS:
              20o
3 - j4 , 34.5


Chapters 5 and 6: Complex Numbers

Mathematician Adrien Douady explains complex numbers. The square root of negative numbers is explained in simple terms. Transforming the plane, deforming pictures, creating fractal images.
